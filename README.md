# How to Host a Resume on Github Pages

## Purpose 
This README describes how to host a resume on Github pages using the strategies mentioned in Andrew Etter's book [**Modern Technical Writing**](https://www.amazon.ca/Modern-Technical-Writing-Introduction-Documentation-ebook/dp/B01A2QL9SS). The book emphasized on helping people create documentation in a sensible way which can increase reader's knowledge. 


## Prerequisites
You will need the following resources before starting:
* A resume for a prospective employer in your field of work. It should be formatted in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and named 'index.md'
* A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
* A Markdown [editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown) and some of its [basics](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) to start with.

## Instructions
### Pick a Markdown editor
Markdown editors are tools to convert text to HTML and allows developers and technical writers to design documents easily. I used Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown) to format the resume because it comes with various extensions which supports shortcuts, style checking, and markdown linting. List of other editors are provided in [Additional Resources](https://github.com/hasan-umanitoba/hasan-umanitoba.github.io/#more-resources). 

### Formatting the resume
I used markdown as a lightweight markup language because I found it easier to learn, read and convert to visually appealing resume. It's also a new standard for text that will be published online. By providing content for simple static sites, it works well with learning management systems and large content management systems. Andrew Etter also describes in their book that it has the cleanest syntax and markdown flavor such as 'GitHub Flavored Markdown' is a popular choice for simple web-based help systems. Using Github's flavored markdown language I formatted my resume to properly my resume into multiple sections such as : 
* Education
* Technical Skills
* Work Experience
* Projects
* Extracurricular Activities There are links to more information about Github flavored Markdown under the [additional resources](#additional-resources) section.




### Setup your GitHub account
You can [join](https://github.com/join) GitHub by filling in the username, email address, and Password
on their signup page. GitHub provides internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers distributed version control and source coude functionality so others can collaborate easily. It's free for users and it allows us to maintain useful lists of documents which keeps them in an organized manner.
Andrew Etter recommends such distributed version control to audience as it is widely accepted by the community of developers. As a result, documentations and branches stay in sync whereas developers are more likely to contribute when they dont need to clone a separate new repository.
