## Instructions

### Setup your GitHub Account
You can [join](https://github.com/join) GitHub by filling in the username, email address, and Passwordon their website. GitHub provides internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers distributed version control and source coude functionality so others can collaborate easily. It's free for users and it allows us to maintain useful lists of documents which keeps them in an organized manner.
Andrew Etter recommends such distributed version control to audience as it is widely accepted by the community of developers. As a result, documentations and branches stay in sync whereas developers are more likely to contribute when they dont need to clone a separate new repository.
